 时间限制:10000ms
 单点时限:1000ms
 内存限制:256MB
 描述
 You are given a sequence S of parentheses.
 You are asked to insert into S as few parentheses as possible so that the resulting sequence T is well matched.
 It's not difficult. But can you tell how many different T you can get?
 Assume S = ()), you can get either (()) or ()().
 输入
 One line contains the sequence S.
 For 30% of the data, 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10
 For 60% of the data, 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 200
 For 100% of the data, 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000
 输出
 Output 2 integers indicating the minimum number of parentheses need to be inserted into S and the number of different T.
